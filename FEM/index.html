                    <h2>Role of women in society</h2>
                    <p>
                        Women are important in our society. Every woman has
                         her own job or duty in this modern society in which men
                          are still the 'strongest gender’; we can´t forget that
                           women´s life is a lot more complicated than a man´s 
                           life. A woman has to take care of her own personal 
                           life and if she is a mother, she has to take care
                            also about her children´s life too. Married women 
                            have lots of worries and believe it or not , they 
                            carry out a more stressful life than married men.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At home the most important person is in most of 
                        the cases is the mother. She is the one that cares
                         about the order, the matter and the health of all
                          the family. But the worries she carry for us are
                           not totally estrange. They care so much for us 
                           because believe it or not , we were part of her 
                           almost nine months and now , as we grow up , we 
                           are the link that will give our parent´s gens the 
                           opportunity of living for another generation. Also,
                            we can see that the man of the house has other 
                            worries such as how to raise money enough to feed
                             his family the entire week. For this reason he
                              can´t accomplish the cares that the woman of the
                               house takes with their own children.

                <h2>Change in role</h2>
                <p>A women's role has changed tremendously and is making its
                     greatest impact in our society today. Many years ago,
                      women's contribution to society was limited and controlled
                       by men. Women are standing tall and are playing a major
                        role in many important areas. Women's role has changed 
                        at an accelerating rate and has part in areas such as
                         Politics, Professional Training Jobs, Medicine, Business
                          and Law. Formerly they were not part of any political
                           matter, but they have advanced in many aspects. For 
                           example, women have attained power and have been growing 
                           in political office.
